# Test assignment 3

Made by cph-sn311, cph-av105, & cph-mf237

Because Flyway only has an API for Java, I was limited in the amount I could use it for my integration tests. However, when I thought about it, I couldn’t see it as a problem because the integration tests would usually run as part of a Continues Integration pipeline which would be able to run the Flyway migration before the integration tests starts.

The requirements in the assignments are quite basic which made it quite difficult to think of any relevant Unit Tests. That is why the unit tests for the service classes only tests whether the storage interface is called or not. The features simply don’t have any logic that can be tested.

## Run with Docker Compose

I have chosen to run both the MySql database and Flyway through docker. Below is a short walkthrough over how to run the project with docker.

First start the datebase and run the migration:

```
> docker-compose up
```

To see the test results for both the unit tests and the integration test, run:

```
> dotnet test
```

And finally to see the Booking System in action, run:

```
> dotnet run -p .\BookingSystem\
```

Or build the docker image and run it:

```
> docker build -t sn311/booking-system .\BookingSystem\
> docker run --rm --network host sn311/booking-system:v1.0
```

## Manually run MySql & Flyway containers

Flyway sometimes failes when running with docker compose. The issue is that Flyway starts before the MySql server and then exits with code 1 without retrying again. This is sometimes solved by pressing `Ctrl+C` and then running docker compose again but not always.

If this happens you can try to mannualy run the containers by following the steps below:

```
> docker run -d --rm -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=testuser123 -p 3307:3306 mysql
```

Now that the database is running we can run the Flyway migration from PowerShell _(make sure that you are inside the Assignment-3 folder)_:

```powershell
> docker run --rm --network host -v "$((Get-Location).Path)\FlywayMigration\conf:/flyway/conf" -v "$((Get-Location).Path)\FlywayMigration\sql:/flyway/sql" flyway/flyway "-teams" migrate
```

If something goes wrong with the migration the last command `migrate` can be changed to one of the following commands:

- `repair` - Repairs the schema history table. This can fix the Flyway migration if it fails.
- `clean` - Drops everything on the schema that Flyway are running its migrations on. This is useful for deleting all dummy data and starting from scratch.
