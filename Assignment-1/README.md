## Throughts on TDD
- **What was positive and good about using TDD?** -
Writing the test before the actual implementation of the feature forced me to think a lot more about the possible pitfalls in the different methods. TDD also forced be to write tests which isn't something I always remember to do.

- **What was annoying or difficult?** -
It was hard to utilize TDD when the functionality of the feature is so simple, especially the temperature converter proved difficult to use TDD on, because after the first test the whole function was fully feature complete.

- **What surprised you?** -
I was surprised to find that writing the tests for things that I knew would fail was a good way to prevent possible bugs in my code. This could be things like checking that an exception was thrown if an invalid value was passed as a parameter. I was also pleasantly surprised by simplicity of TDD when began to think test as the initial thing for a feature.

- **Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldn't otherwise have though of?** -
Again because of the limited scope of the features, it wasn't possible to use TDD to its full capability. That being said, I can absolutely see TDD help me write test i wouldn't have written otherwise, because it forces me to think about the result of the test from the beginning.
