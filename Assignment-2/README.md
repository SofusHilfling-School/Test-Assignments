- Test the ergonomics of using the mouse, this can include the following tests:
    - How diffrent hand sizes fit the shape of the mouse.

- Test of the software for the mouse, this inclues drives or costimization software.
    - Test that the mouse driver works on spcific versions of Windows, Linux, and Mac (maybe even things like ipads or game consoles)
    - Usual software testing on the costimzation software including unit tests and user tests
